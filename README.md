# Done it - To-Do App

**Done it** is a simple and efficient To-Do App designed to help you manage your tasks effectively. Built with React [Vite], Context API, and Tailwind CSS, this app allows you to create tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. It also includes a task counter and saves your tasks in the browser's LocalStorage so that your tasks are preserved between sessions.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Create tasks with a simple input field.
- **Mark as Done:** Easily mark tasks as completed, which applies a strikethrough style and changes the color.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that you no longer need.
- **Task Counters:** Display the total number of tasks and the count of completed tasks.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your tasks are saved in LocalStorage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
- **Link Detection:** Automatically detects URLs in your tasks and wraps them with `<a>` tags.
